      <description>The St Vrain range has sustained more wind damage than usual. There are several stacks of bales down and some 3D targets have had antlers blown away.
At the sight in range the bales are down at the 100 yard and 80 yard positions. There is also some damage at the 20 yard position. The gray cover on the big round target at 80 yards was shredded and was removed. The target face is still shootable (for now).</description>

      <description>You should not be at the range or anywhere on the property except from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm.
The Colorado Parks and Wildlife restricts this area because it is a bald eagle roosting and nesting area.
There are no member exceptions to this restriction for any reason. Presence at the range outside these hours technically is consider trespassing.
These restrictions remain in effect until lifted next spring.</description>
